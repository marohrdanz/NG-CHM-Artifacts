NG-CHM FILE VIEWER README: 

You have downloaded the NG-CHM File Viewer software application.  
This small package of application files can be used to open 
and view .NGCHM files containing heatmaps that have been
downloaded from the web based NGCHM application.

In order to install and use this local heatmap file viewer,
please perform the following steps:
1. Save the recently downloaded zip file NGCHM_FileApp.zip
   (usually located in your Downloads directory) to a directory
   that you have created on your workstation as a destination for
   the NGCHM File Viewer software (e.g C:\NGCHM_Viewer).  
2. Extract the contents of the application download zip file 
   into this new directory by right-clicking on the file and
   selecting "Extract All...".  Once this has completed, you have
   installed the software locally on your machine.
3. Double-click the chm.html file to open the NG-CHM File Viewer
   application in your browser. (You may wish to create a 
   bookmark for the viewer in your browser at this time)

To view .ngchm files in the NG-CHM File Viewer, simply press the 
"Choose File" button, navigate your directories to the heatmap
.ngchm file that you wish to view, and press "Open".
